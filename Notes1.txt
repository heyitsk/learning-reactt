we have bundelers -> webpack , parcel , vite etc and what they do is they bundel the entire code and make it ready to push it into production 
dependencies are what our project is dependent on for  working 
there are two type of dependencies which we can install - > normal dependency , dev dependency
dev dependency -> required in development  (npm install -D parcel )
normal dependency -> used in production also 





the difference btw package.json and package-lock.json is->
package.json-> it specifies the dependencies you need but not the exact version 
               it puts like a react: ^17.0.0 which means that it's compatible with version 17 of react. when u or someone installs the project it will fetch newer closer version like 17.1.1
package-lock.json-> it notes the exact version of dependencies when they were installed
               let's say when you downloaded the version was react: 17.0.0. So now when you or someone else installs the project it will fetch this exact version 17.0.0 so that your app behaves consitently irrespective of the newer versions
NOTE :- it is important to put both of these files on github as they have the required dependencies and their versions which are important for our project. And since these files will be on github we just have to do "npm install" to regenerate the entire node_modules folder






transitive dependencies -> we have parcel as a dev dependency for our project now parcel will have its own dependencies which will have their own dependencies and it goes on that's why whenn we do npm install parcel so many things get inside the node_modules folder and each dependencies will have their own package.json and package-lock.json





we removed the cdn links from the index.html since it is not a good paractice and we installed react and react-dom in the node modules using npm install react and npm install react-dom. 
Now the app.js file was using react and react-dom bcz it was in the index.html file now we need to import it from the node modules so we do   * import React from "react";   import ReactDOM from "react-dom"; *






as soon as we ignite the app and change anything and save it, it quickly shows the change on the page. How? 
Parcel keeps a watch on all the files using File watching algorithm (which is written in C++) and perfroms something called as "HMR or HOT MODULE REPLACEMENT"
Parcel also cache all our files making the build faster since it has cache of our files with the subsequent builds we don't have to reprocess these files from scratch 







"broweserslist":[
    "last 2 version"
  ]
what this does is it makes sure that our app run definitly on last 2 versions of all apps which u can check on browserslist.dev but it makes the code slower as it attaches different dependencies of different broswers





if you go to a new company and don't know how to start the app go to package.json -> scripts -> you'll find commands like start, build etc and then simply do "npm run script_name"



BABBLE IS A TRANSPILER
React.createElement => creates react element (object) => html element by .render
however the JSX is NOT a valid javascript syntax, JS engine and browser cannot understand it. So how does that work?
The jsx code => transpiled into React.createElement by BABLE => into react code that browser and js engine understands
JSX code => React.createElement => creates react element (object) => html element by .render





you can write js inside jsx by using {} anything inside these brackets will run as normal js code 




const RestCard = (props) => {
    
    return(
        ...
                <h4>{props.resname}</h4>
                <h5>{props.reslocation}</h5>
        ...
    )
}
instead of this some developers "destructure it on the fly" ->
const RestCard = ({resname, reslocation}) => {
    
    return(
        ...
                <h4>{resname}</h4>
                <h5>{reslocation}</h5>
        ...
    )
}
or
const RestCard = (props) => {
    const {resname, reslocation} = props
    return(
        ...
                <h4>{resname}</h4>
                <h5>{reslocation}</h5>
        ...
    )
}







const RestCard = (props) => {
    const {resInfo} = props;
     const {name, locality, costForTwo, cloudinaryImageId} = resInfo?.info
    
    return(
        <div id="rest-card">
           ..
            <div id="rest-info">
                <h4>{name}</h4>
                <h5>{locality}</h5>
                <h6>{costForTwo}</h6>
            </div>
        </div>
    )
}
const Body = () => {
    return(
        ...
            <div id="restcard-container">
                {
                  resList.map(restaurant => <RestCard resInfo={restaurant}/>)
                }
        </div>
    )
}
basically what have we done is resList is an array which contained multiple objects and har object ko hamne restaurant bola and each restaurantobject got stored in the resInfo. Props wrapped the resInfo in a object{ resInfo:{}}.
So now we'll destructure it hamne props object me se resInfo nikala stored it and fir hamne resInfo.info me se baaki var nikale and stored them 





"config driven ui" -> is a UI which is driven by configs. Like for example you want to show some offers in delhi and some different offers in mumbai how would u do that in the same website. You'll make your UI config driven which means that the configs provided by the backend will change the ui of the website respectively 




when we use resuable components like restcard we use unique key bcz lets say we don't have unique keys for existing cards and now we need to enter a new RestCard at beginning, react will clean the entire container and "re-render" all the RestCards.
If we have unique keys for existing RestCards then react will know that they were existing and the react will only render 1 one card and not all 
You can also use index(i) as the key 
resList.map((restaurant, index) => <RestCard key={index} resInfo={restaurant}/>)
BUT THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED
Let me explain, a key is the only thing React uses to identify DOM elements. What happens if you push an item to the list or remove something in the middle? If the key is same as before React assumes that the DOM element represents the same component as before. But that is no longer true.






+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
NOW WE'RE STRUCTURING OUR CODE->
-All js file (app) inside src 
--All components in components folder. Name of all component file start from caps and exact same as component name
--all images and data in utilities folder






two types of import and export
default -> when u want to export only 1 component 
export default compname
import compname from "path"


named-> when u want to export multiple components 
export const compname
import {compname} from "path"





Earlier functional component didn't have access to state management and lifecycle method so we used class components
HOOKS allowed us to do it, they make functional component behave like class component 

react hooks are normal js functions given to us by react and it comes with superpowers. They were written by facebook developers and they are written inside React which we've imported by npm install react
(anything that starts with "use" is a hook) 
Two most important hooks
-UseState() -> helps to create super powerful js  variable. Whenever a state variable updates react re-renders the component 
               You import it from "react" using *named import*-> import {useState} from "react"
               what this does is it returns the state variable and we store it in an array 
               const [arr] = useState()
               we pass an array inside useState if not passed it'll take nothing it's like declaring a normal js variable an empty array let arr = [];
               const [arr] = useState([x]) x becomes the default value of arr
               const [arr, setarr] = useState([x]). The second parameter is the setarr function which helps to  change the UI when list changes and we pass the filtered list in setarr(filtered list) to change the UI 
                WHEN WE CHANGE THE NORMAL JS VARIABLE THE UI DOESN'T UPDATE. SO TO BIND THE CHANGES WITH THE UI WE USE UseState AS IT CHANGES THE STATE OF A VARIABLE AS SOON AS SOME EVENT IS DONE AND THEN REACT RECOGNIZES THAT VARIABLE AND CHANGES IT ON THE UI AS WELL
                defN - > whenever state variable updates , react triggers a reconcilation cycle or rerenders the components and update the UI 
                TIP:- always write this inside the component at the top where the function starts
                        never use it inside if else, for, functions
-UseEffect() -> this will be called everytime my component renders
                two arguments, 1- callback function    2- dependency array
                ALWAYS CALLED ONCE AFTER INTIAL RENDER 
                if you pass without dependency array the UseEffect calls each time the component renders 
                if you pass [] empty dependency array it will be called only "once" on the initial render
                if you pass [x], it will be called everytime x is updated
                This is used for perferoming an async task like fetching data from api, serinterval, settimeout 




WHY DO WE USE HOOKS?
-earlier the js had two components the functional and the class. The functional components didn't have access to react life cycle and couldn't manage their own state while class components were able to do that. So we had to use both components in our code which makes it difficult and moreover we had to access state vars using this.var etc. 
Hooks fixed this shortcoming of functional component, now we can use hooks to make functional component access react life cycle


 const [restaurantList, setrestaurantlist] = useState(resList)
 or 
 const arr = useState(resList)
 [restaurantList, setrestaurantlist] = arr
 or 
 const arr = useState(resList)
 restaurantList= arr[0]
 setrestaurantlist = arr[1]





Why is react fast?
    Bcz it does efficient DOM manupulation
How?
    Using virtual dom which is a represntation of actual dom (all html tags etc). virtual dom is an "object" represntation of the actual dom
So why does this make it fast?
    In React 16 react fibre was introduced  which follows reconcilation algorithm basically a diff algorithm which compares the old virtual dom to the new virtual dom and if it finds a difference it updates that difference. In our example of rest cards as soon as the state changes when we **call the setrestaurantlist** the react runs the algorithm finds out the difference btw virtual doms and re-renders the UI 





there are two approaches to render a page 
-1st -> the page loads --- the Api loads (takes 500ms) --> after 500ms the entire page rerenders 
-2nd -> the page loads --- the UI renders(like skeleton) --- Api loads --> after 500ms the entire page rerenders with the UI. The ensures better UX
In react we always use the 2nd approach 




we import the UseEffect just like useState using named import
UseEffect will have 2 parameters, 1st the arrow func 2nd the dependency array 
This will run after the entire body renders 





now even after using UseEffect the body gets rendered quickly but is blank this makes the UI look poor 
to improve it -> we use shimmer ui -> the page loads fake cards until the data is fetched from api
so the 2nd approach that we talked about ----
load the page -- render the shimmer UI -- api loads -- rerender it with real data
(even though it renders twice react has fast render cycles)






if (restaurantList.length===0){
        return <Shimmer/>
    }
or 
return restaurantList.length===0 ? (<Shimmer/>) : (div ......)








 <button onClick={()=>{setbuttonState ("logout")}}>{buttonState}</button>
 When you click on this the header is rendered again with the new change and it happenss so quickly
 ----A good question const [buttonState, setbuttonState]= useState(["login"]); since it is a const variable how are you changing its value to logout 
 See when the button is clicked the whole header component is rendered again which means that the header function is called again. And this the time varible will have the value as logout 







 <input type="text" placeholder="Search.." 
                value={searchText}
                onChange={(e)=>{
                    setsearchText(e.target.value)
                }}></input>
to get the text that user is typing in this input field we need to "bind" it to a local statevariable having value "" int hebeginning.
When the user writes something and the text changes the input field is still bind to the searchText which has an empty string so to accept the change and show it we use onChange and update the searchText using setsearchText

NOTE:- WE  did the console.log("body rendered") and we see that it gets logged each time a letter is typed this means each time user writes a letter the searchText updates and the input field updates so each time the body component is rendered EVEN WITH THE BACKSPACE IF WE'RE REMOVING A LETTER 








the issue that we are facing it if we've searched something and that res cards get rendered and now we search another restaurant it won't search bcz now the reslist contains the filtered list and it does not have all the restaurants which reslist had in the beginning. So we must make another state variable for the filtered list








when we did header render, body render and footer render inside their own component. when the page loads we see something interesting 
-header rendered
-body rendered
-footer rendered
-body rendered (again bcz now the data was fetched from API )







lets create the about us page ---- we will do it using routing which is done on the FoodApp file
we import createBrowserRouter and we are creating browsing configuration inside app router
createBrowserRouter([{path:"", element:</>},{}]) it takes an array of object each object consist of a path and a component which will be rendered on the path
NOW you've "CREATED" the router config, you need to provide it else it will not show 
for that we use another function called RouterProvider
it also has useRouteError which helps to deal with errors efficiently 






<li><Link to="/contact">Contact</Link></li> 
when we use this instead of our anchor tag our whole page does not get refreshed 
So when u click on the about link the header remains intact and the entire outlet gets replaced by about component you can see it in the HTML as well 
<a> ------> reloads the entire page 
<link to> ------> refreshes the components
Note:- under the hood link uses anchor tag if you look at it in the browser dev and react router dom keep a track of it 







2 types of ROUTING
-client side routing -> when u load the app for the first time it already has code for all the pages, about, contact etc so, 
                        when clicked upon it quickly changes the components 
                        No network calls are made after the API call to fetch card data
                        This is why it is a single page application 
-server side routing -> when u click on the about the request gets sent to the server and the server sends back the about page.
                        It makes network calls








useEffect(async()=> {
        const api = await fetch(MENU_URL)
        const data = await api.json();
        console.log(data);
        
    },[])
what i did here is wrong as it showed a warning that "useEffect must not return anything except a function"











const response = await axios.get("url")
this provides an object containing our api data, headers, request etc
response.data gives the object containing articles
response.data.articles gives us the req array 




import React from "react";
class About extends React.Component{}
or 
import {Component} from "react";
class About extends Component{}


about is a functional compoennt and inside it Userclass is a class based component now when react loads and comes across the class based components, "an instance of class component is created"
-now when the instance is created first of all the constructor function will be called and then render will be called


 
 
 
 
what if we male parent component (about) as a class based compoennt as well 
-parent contructor -> parent render -> child constructor -> child render 



now we use another method called "componentDidMount" this loads when react updates the DOM 
parent constructor -> parent render -> while rendereing it indentifies a child class component so the life cycle of child component is initiated -> child constructor -> child render -> since the child component is rendered the child component mount will be called -> this finishes the parent render cycle now the parent component mount will run 




we use componentDidMount to make "api calls" bcz of the behaviour that it will be called after component is rendered
see we studied that there are 2 methods to make api calls and we want the second where 
page loads-> body renders -> api calls -> body rerendered with the data fetched from api 
that's why this componentDidMount is used to call api as it will run after body rendersx   



the output -> 
parent constructor 
parent render 
1stchild constructor
1stchild render 
2ndchild constructor 
2ndchild render 
1stchild component mount 
2ndchild component mount
parent component mount
whis occurs because of the react life cycle which consist of 2 phases -render phase -commit phase and it happens for each component
-render phase 
    - constructor called
    - render called
- commit phase 
    - changes to DOM
    - componentDidMount

But why did 1stchild component mount 2ndchild component mount they got printed later??
- React did this to optimize the code it will batch the render phase of these two children and then their commit phase will happen
--But why does it happen like this 
--- This happens bcz render phase is very fast and commit phase takes it as it contains dom manupulation which is the most expensive task so it first completed the rendering of toh children and then commit them 









to understand react life cycle https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/







if you go to network -> js you'll see there's just 1 single js file which contains all the code that parcel bundeled into single js file 
if we're making a big app and all the code comes inside this then it's size will increase and will take more time to load so we distribute it 
ex :- swiggy has swiggyinstamart which is in itself a big file so we can't put them in 1 single file. When we click on the instamart only then we want the code to load
This is called 
-Chunking
-Code splitting
-Dynamic bundling 
-lazy loading
-on demand loading




we made a grocery component and imported it normally 
NOW to do it by lazy loading we will use 
import { lazy } from "react";
lazy is a function given by react which takes a callback function and where we use import. This import is different from normal import as it is a function and it takes the path of the grocery component 
const Grocery = lazy(()=>import("./components/Grocery"))
BUT IT STILL DOESN'T LOAD WHEN CLICKED UPON
-- this happens bcz grocery is clicked it takes some time to load it and in that time react wants to show something so we use a component called "Suspense", we can wrap the grocery component inside it and it also takes a fallback which is basically what to show when screen is loading 




You said:
lemme explain it according to my understanding and check if i'm correct or not. when we map the restaurant list and link it to the restaurant.info.id the url is lets suppose restaurant/655882 so the path for a certain menu becomes restaurant/655882 and when this menu component opens it uses the useparams and extracts the resid from the url which is 655882 and then according to logic append in the api 





    filteredList is the original, unmodified dataset that remains intact after fetching the data from the API. It serves as the "source of truth" that we use for applying filters, searches, or resets.

    restaurantList is the dynamic dataset that changes depending on user interactions (like filtering or searching). It is the working list that is displayed on the UI.

How It Works

    Initial State:
        After fetching data from the API:

    setRestaurantList(dataFromAPI);
    setFilteredList(dataFromAPI);

    At this point:
        filteredList contains the original, unmodified data.
        restaurantList contains the same data and is displayed on the UI.

Filtering (e.g., Top Rated):

    When you apply a filter:

    const topRated = filteredList.filter(restaurant => restaurant.info.avgRating > 4);
    setRestaurantList(topRated);

        The filteredList remains unchanged.
        The restaurantList is updated with the filtered data, and the UI reflects this change.

Search:

    When the user searches for something:

    const searchResults = filteredList.filter(restaurant =>
      restaurant.info.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchText.toLowerCase())
    );
    setRestaurantList(searchResults);

        Again, the filteredList remains the same.
        The restaurantList is updated with the search results and the UI reflects these results.

Reset:

    If the user wants to clear the filters or reset the search:

        setRestaurantList(filteredList);

            The restaurantList is reset to the original data stored in filteredList.

Does the Original restaurantList Remain Intact?

No, the restaurantList is the working state and does not stay intact. It is updated dynamically based on user interactions.

However:

    The filteredList does remain intact as the original dataset.
    Any changes to restaurantList are derived from filteredList, ensuring the original dataset is always available for resets or new filters.










Higher Order component are functions that take components as argument and return enhanced component 
older compoennt ->>>> HOCs ->>>> newer components

const withOpenLabel = (RestCard)=>{
    return()=>{
        return(
            <div>
                <label>Is Open</label>
                <RestCard/>
            </div>
        )
    }
}
in this withOpenLabel is a HOC which takes RestCard as input and return a component which is this
 ()=>{
        return(
            <div>
                <label>Is Open</label>
                <RestCard/>
            </div>
        )
    } this is a component which it returns 



<RestaurntCardOpen resInfo={restaurant}/> 
or
<withOpenLabel (restaurant)(resInfo={restaurant})/>
Both are correct but 1st one is more suitable as it is more readable and if we have to use it mulitple times just have to write RestaurntCardOpen and use it 






import React, { useState } from 'react'
import ItemList from './ItemList';

const ResCategory = ({data}) => {
    console.log(data);
    const[showList, setShowList] = useState(false)
    
    const handleClick= ()=>{
        setShowList(!showList)
    }
  return (
    <div className='bg-gray-200 w-6/12 mx-auto my-4 shadow-md rounded-md cursor-pointer' onClick={handleClick}>
        {/* accordian header */}
        <div className='font-bold p-4 flex justify-between'>
            <span>{data.title} ({data.itemCards.length})</span>
            <span>⬇️</span>
        </div>

        {/* accordian body */}
        <div>
            {showList && <ItemList info={data.itemCards}/>}
        </div>
    </div>
    
  )
}

export default ResCategory
------HERE, each resCategory has their own useState. 


WHAT  I WANT IS WHEN I CLICK ON ONE OTHERS COLLAPSE.
--right now it is not possible bcz each item has its own useState and they manage it themselves. Recommended handles its own  use state if it is clicked then the list items expands, at this time the Flat menu does not have an idea about whats going on in the Recommended section bcz it has its own use state.
--To make this feature i want the "state to be lifted up" means the parent controls the state and not the children themselves. The parent which is the menu controls the state of its children which means that instead of giving the power of expand and collapse to each item i want the parent to have the power. Right now it is an uncontrolled component as the parent has no control over it 




Sometimes, you want the state of two components to always change together. To do it, remove state from both of them, move it to their closest common parent, and then pass it down to them via props. This is known as lifting state up, and it’s one of the most common things you will do writing React code.












2 ways of using context 
-- functional compoennt -> useContext
-- class based component -> <userContext.Consumer>
                        {(data)=>{
                            console.log(data);
                            
                        }}
                    </userContext.Consumer> inside the .consumer pass a callback function which has access to the data passed in the create context 
now if lessay we have  logged in by the authentication process and now we want to add username instead of default user we use 
        <userContext.Provider value={{loggedInUser:"kushagra"}}> 



<userContext.Provider value={{loggedInUser:"kushagra"}}>
        <Header/>
        <Outlet/>
        <Footer/>
        </userContext.Provider> in this provider wraps the entire app so all component will be able to access kushagra 

but if we just wrap header then only header will be able to access kushagra while others access ddefault user 


<userContext.Provider value={{loggedInUser:"kushagra"}}>
        <userContext.Provider value={{loggedInUser:"hello"}}>
        <Header/>
        </userContext.Provider>
        
        <Outlet/>
        <Footer/>
        </userContext.Provider> now the header will have hello and the entire app will have kushagra 



const [userName, setUserName] = useState("default user")

    return (
    <div id="FoodApp">
        <userContext.Provider value={{loggedInUser:userName}}>
        <Header/>
        <Outlet/>
        <Footer/>
        </userContext.Provider>

    </div>
    )
NOW I WANT TO CHANGE THE USERNAME TO WHAT I TYPE IN THE INPUT FIELD.
how can i change the value of username?
-by setUserName
how can i access setUserName from body?
-by passing it in the value 
--value={{loggedInUser:userName}, setUserName} like along with the username we are passing a function to edit it which can also be accessed from anywhere 
now the username is changed even in the aboutus page which comes via lazy loading even there the loggedInUser is the new value
